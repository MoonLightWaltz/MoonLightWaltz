<h2> Hey, I'm Lee </h2>
  <div>
  <p> I am a Front-End Developer with fundemental knowledge of HTML, JavaScript, CSS and React. I come from a tech background as an IT Support Technician at Zen Focus Tech. I am a junior level developer and I am eager to learn new skills from new opportunities. I enjoy the process of problem solving and working with computers. Tech is fascinating to me because there is always something new to learn. Once I have finished refining my skills in front-end I plan to study back-end as well. Making my way towards being a Full-Stack Developer. <p>
